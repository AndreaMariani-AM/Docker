# ccache = Compiler Cache, speeds up recompilation by caching previous compilation and detecting when the same compilation is being done again
# to compile a program = produce a file wit binary code which is directly readable by the machine you are on. File's called executable.
# `gcc` is the compile cmd to compile C code in linux.

max_size = 5.0G
# Important for R CMD INSTALL *.tar.gz as tarballs are expanded freshly -> fresh ctime
# tarball = desired files packed into a single tar file and then compress with gzip.

sloppiness = include_file_ctime
# inclide_file_ctime is a sloppines value, it's used to tell ccache to "relax" some checks in order to increase hit rate, include_file_ctime = ccache won't cache a file if it includes
# a header whose ctime is too new. ctime = status change time.

# also important as the (temp.) directory name will differ
hash_dir = false
# If true (which is the default), ccache will include the current working directory (CWD) in the hash that is used to distinguish two compilations when generating debug info
# You can disable this option to get cache hits when compiling the same source code in different directories if you donâ€™t mind that CWD in the debug info might be incorrect.
