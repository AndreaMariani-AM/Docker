# Docker
This repo is to test/build various Docker images i'll use in the future. 
It contains **ChIPseq**, **RNAseq** and other **bioinformatics pipelines** images. 
From these Docker images i will create singularity images that will work with snakemake pipelines. An example of workflow can be found here and notes on general stuff that might be useful are there.
